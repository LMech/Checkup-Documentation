  abstract       = {Healthcare is an indispensable part of human life and chronic illnesses like cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have a deeply negative impact on the healthcare sector. Since the ever-growing population of chronic patients cannot be managed at hospitals, therefore, there is an urgent need for periodic monitoring of vital parameters and apposite treatment of these patients. In this paper, an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) -based remote patient monitoring system is proposed which is based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and edge computing. The primary focus of this paper is to develop an embedded prototype that can be used for remote monitoring of cardiovascular patients. The system will continuously monitor physiological parameters like body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation, and then report the health status to the authenticated users. The system employs edge computing to perform multiple functionalities including health status inference using a Machine Learning (ML) model which makes predictions on real-time data, alert notifications in case of an emergency, and transferring data between the sensor network and the cloud. A web-based application is developed for the depiction of raw data and ML results and to provide a direct communication channel between the patient and the doctor. The ML module achieved an accuracy of 96.26% on the test set using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) algorithm. This solution aims to address the sense of emergency due to the alarming statistics that highlight the mortality rate of cardiovascular patients. The project will enable a smart option based on IoT and ML to improve standards of living and prove crucial in saving human lives.},

  title     = {An IoT-Based E-Health Monitoring System Using ECG Signal},
  abstract  = {In this paper, we present an Internet of Things (IoT)-based health care system implementation scheme using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) chain and ElectroCardioGram (ECG) sensors within the context of e-Health. The scheme aims to facilitate improved monitoring and timely intervention for Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVD) patients thereby enhancing medical services for such patients. As real-time monitoring of patients from different locations remains a critical challenge for IoT-based health care systems, this implementation employs patient path estimator, patient table and alert management schemes within the hospital to facilitate the localisation and timely intervention for the treatment of CVD patients.},
